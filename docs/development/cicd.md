# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The Spatium project uses a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline built with GitHub Actions to ensure code quality, security, and reliable releases. The pipeline is designed to catch issues early, maintain high code standards, and automate the release process.

## Pipeline Structure

- Nightly builds (2 AM UTC daily)

**Jobs:**

#### Lint & Format
- Code formatting checks with Ruff
- Code linting with comprehensive rule sets
- YAML validation
- Type checking with MyPy

#### Security Scan

- Coverage threshold enforcement (â‰¥80%)
- Parallel test execution for speed
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- PR comments with coverage information

#### Integration Tests
- Tests requiring Docker/ContainerLab
- Service integration validation
- Real-world scenario testing

#### Documentation Build
- MkDocs documentation compilation
- Link validation

#### Performance Tests
- Performance benchmarks (main branch only)
- Regression detection

#### Compatibility Tests
- Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Multiple Python version validation

#### Quality Gate
- Aggregates all job results
- Prevents merging if any critical checks fail
- Clear pass/fail status for the entire pipeline

### 2. Release Management - `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Git tags matching `v*` pattern
- Manual workflow dispatch with version input

**Jobs:**

#### Validate Release
- Version format validation
- Duplicate version checking
- Automatic changelog generation
- Release readiness verification

#### Test Release Build

#### Security Scan
- Comprehensive security analysis
- Dependency vulnerability assessment
- Security report generation

#### Build Package
- Python package creation
- Package integrity verification
- Version synchronization

#### Build Docker
- Multi-architecture Docker images (amd64, arm64)
- Container registry publishing
- Image testing and validation

#### Create Release
- GitHub release creation
- Asset upload (packages, reports)
- Changelog inclusion
- Release notes generation

#### Deploy Documentation
- Documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- Version-specific documentation

#### Notification
- Success/failure notifications
- Release announcement

### 3. Dependency Management - `.github/workflows/dependency-updates.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Weekly schedule (Mondays at 9 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Features:**
- Automated dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Test execution with updated dependencies
- Automated pull request creation
- Dependency change reports

### 4. Dependabot Configuration - `.github/dependabot.yml`

**Managed Ecosystems:**
- Python dependencies (pip)
- GitHub Actions
- Docker base images

**Features:**
- Weekly update schedules
- Automatic PR creation
- Team assignment and review
- Proper labeling and categorization
- Commit message conventions

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: Comprehensive rule set with Ruff
- **Formatting**: Consistent code style enforcement
- **Type Safety**: MyPy type checking
- **Documentation**: Docstring requirements
- **Complexity**: McCabe complexity limits

### Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks
- **Code Analysis**: Static security analysis
- **Secret Detection**: Automatic secret scanning
- **Supply Chain**: Dependency integrity verification

### Testing
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Test Types**: Unit, integration, and compatibility tests
- **Performance**: Benchmark tracking
- **Timeout**: Test execution time limits

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. Run tests locally:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/
   ```

3. Check code quality:
   ```bash
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run ruff format .
   uv run mypy spatium/
   ```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Ensure all pre-commit checks pass
4. Submit pull request with:
   - Clear description
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation updates
5. Automated checks run on PR
6. Code review and approval required
7. Merge after all checks pass

### Release Process
1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure all features are merged to `main`
   - Update version in `pyproject.toml`
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

2. **Release Creation**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Automated Steps**:
   - CI pipeline validates release
   - Builds and tests packages
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Publishes Docker images
   - Deploys documentation

### Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Implement minimal fix with tests
3. Fast-track review process
4. Create patch version tag
5. Automated release deployment

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Pipeline Monitoring
